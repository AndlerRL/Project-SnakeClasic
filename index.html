			The Snake Clasic game has been done under a canvas element, where you can appreciate the clasic style of this game. <br>
			As is shown, it offers 3 difficulties where only affect snake's velocity. It is a simple game, but as a proff of skills, and my first game, for me it has been considered a treasure since I made it at the beggining of my carreer as full-stack JavaScript Developer. Enjoy :)
